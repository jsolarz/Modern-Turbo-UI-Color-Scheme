# Icon Requirements

For marketplace publishing, you need to create an `icon.png` file.

## Specifications

- **Size**: 128x128 pixels
- **Format**: PNG
- **Location**: Root of the `vscode/` folder
- **File name**: `icon.png`

## Design Suggestions

The icon should represent the theme visually. Consider:

1. **Turbo Pascal Logo**: Classic Borland Turbo Pascal logo or stylized version
2. **Color Scheme**: Use the theme's signature colors (dark blue #0000AA or navy #252b36)
3. **Simple Design**: Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes
4. **High Contrast**: Ensure it's visible on both light and dark backgrounds

## Tools

You can create the icon using:
- Image editing software (Photoshop, GIMP, Figma)
- Online icon generators
- AI image generators with appropriate prompts

## Example Concept

- Dark blue/navy background
- White or yellow text/icon representing "TP" or "Turbo Pascal"
- Simple, clean design
- High contrast for visibility

Once created, place the `icon.png` file in the `vscode/` directory and it will be automatically included in the extension package.
